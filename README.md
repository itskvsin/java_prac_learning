### 📝 Question 1

Write a Java program to swap the values of two variables using a third variable. Also, modify your program to perform the swap without using a third variable.

### 📝 Question 2

Write a Java program that accepts an integer from the user and checks whether the given number is even or odd. Use the modulus operator to determine the result.

### 📝 Question 3

Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a given number. Accept the number from the user and use a loop (for or while) to perform the calculation.

### 📝 Question 4

Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms. Accept the value of n from the user and display the series in proper format.  
**Output Example:** `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21`

### 📝 Question 5

Write a Java program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 1331).

### 📝 Question 6

Write a Java program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.  
An Armstrong number is one where the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the number itself (e.g., 153, 370, 371, 407).

### 📝 Question 7

Write a Java program to check whether a given number is prime or not. Accept the number from the user and display the result accordingly.

### 📝 Question 8

Write a Java program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not.  
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

### 📝 Question 9

Write a Java program to calculate the power of a number. Accept base and exponent from the user and calculate using a loop.  
**Example:** 2⁵ = 32

### 📝 Question 10

Write a Java program to check whether a number is a perfect number or not.  
A perfect number is one whose sum of proper divisors equals the number itself.  
**Example:** 6 → 1+2+3 = 6
